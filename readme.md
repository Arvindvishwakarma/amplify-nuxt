### When Cloning

If you should happen to clone down this repository you'll need to configure the project with your project's Amplify details. To do so, run the below command in your terminal and walk through the configuration steps/questions.

This will pull down the amplify directory in addition to generating your `aws-exports.js` file.

```
  $ amplify pull
```
